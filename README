This repo contains the code for the examples in the goChem wiki:

www.github.com/rmera/gochem/wiki

In addition, small programs that I have found useful are included.
They perform simple tasks like aligning the XY plane with an 
arbitrary plane, pre-optimizing a structure at sempiempirical 
level and preparing an input for a subsequent DFT calculation, 
calculating improper dihedral angles, among others.

If you need a binary for any of these, just let me know.
