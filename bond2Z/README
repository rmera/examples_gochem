USE:

./bond2Z   file.xyz "index_atom_1 index_atom2"

The indexes are zero-based, as in C or python.

Example:

./bond2Z file.xyz "0 5"

The vector connecting atoms 0 and 5 will become the Z axis.

As an output, the program will write a file called "aligned.xyz"
which will have the rotated molecule (also centered in the mass center).
